## Structs Used

### Struct Addrinfo

```
struct addrinfo {
    int ai_flags; // AI_PASSIVE, AI_CANONNAME, etc.
    int ai_family; // AF_INET, AF_INET6, AF_UNSPEC
    int ai_socktype; // SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_DGRAM
    int ai_protocol; // use 0 for "any"
    size_t ai_addrlen; // size of ai_addr in bytes
    struct sockaddr *ai_addr; // struct sockaddr_in or _in6
    char *ai_canonname; // full canonical hostname
    struct addrinfo *ai_next; // linked list, next node
};
```

This struct is used in host name lookups, and service name lookups. This struct is loaded with information and then the [`getaddrinfo()`](#getaddrinfo) function is called.

This is a linked list, as `*ai_next` points to the next element.

The pointer `ai_addr` points to the [struct sockaddr](#sockaddr). It holds socket address information for different types of sockets.

### Struct Sockaddr

```
struct sockaddr {
unsigned short sa_family; // address family, AF_xxx
    char sa_data[14]; // 14 bytes of protocol address
};
```

This struct holds address information for different types of sockets.

1. `sa_family` can be `AF_INET(IPv4)` or `AF_INET6(IPv6)`.
2. `sa_data` contains destination address and port number.

A parallel [struct `sockaddr_in`](#struct-sockaddr_in) is used for IPv4. Pointers to `struct sockaddr` can be cast to pointers of `struct sockadd_in`.

### Struct Sockaddr_In

```
struct sockaddr_in {
    short int sin_family; // Address family, AF_INET
    unsigned short int sin_port; // Port number
    struct in_addr sin_addr; // Internet address
    unsigned char sin_zero[8]; // Same size as struct sockaddr
};
```

1. `sin_zero` is used to pad this struct with zeros to make its length equal to [Struct Sockaddr](#struct-sockaddr)
2. [`struct in_addr`](#struct-in_addr) is used to store the IPv4 address.

### Struct In_Addr

```
// (IPv4 only--see struct in6_addr for IPv6)
// Internet address (a structure for historical reasons)
struct in_addr {
    uint32_t s_addr; // that's a 32-bit int (4 bytes)
};
```

### Struct Timespec

```
struct timespec {
    time_t tv_sec; // seconds
    long tv_nsec; // nanoseconds
};
```

This struct is used to store the time in seconds and nanoseconds.

1. `tv_sec` is the number of seconds.
2. `tv_nsec` is the number of nanoseconds.

## Functions Used

### GetAddrInfo()

`getaddrinfo()` helps set up the structs you need later on. This function does DNS Lookups and service name lookups and fills all the necessary structs.

```
int getaddrinfo(
    const char *node, // e.g. "www.example.com" or IP
    const char *service, // e.g. "http" or port number const struct addrinfo *hints,
    struct addrinfo **res
    );
```

This gives a linked list of [`struct addrinfo`](#struct-addrinfo), res, of results.

1. The Node parameter is the hostname or IP Address to connect to.
2. The Service parameter is a port number or the name of a service like "ftp", "telnet", or "smtp" etc.
3. The Hint parameter points to a [`struct addrinfo`](#struct-addrinfo) that is already filled out with relevant information.

**freeaddrinfo()** is used to free up the linked list `res`.

### Gai_Strerror()

```
const char *gai_strerror(int errcode);
```

`gai_strerror()` returns a string describing the error value passed in the argument errcode.

### Socket()

```

`socket()` simply returns to you a socket descriptor that you can use in later system calls, or -1 on error. The global variable errno is set to the errorâ€™s value.

1. Domain is `PF_INET` (IPv4) or `PF_INET6`(IPv6).
2. Type is `SOCK_STREAM`(TCP) or `SOCK_DGRAM`(UDP).
3. Protocol can be set by `getprotobyname('tcp')` or `getprotobyname('udp')`.

3. `...` is the variable number of arguments to be printed according to the format string.

### Perror()

```
void perror(const char *s);
```

`perror()` prints a descriptive error message to stderr. It takes the string s as an argument and prints it followed by a colon and then prints the error message corresponding to the current value of errno.

### Close()

```
#include <unistd.h>

int close(int fd);
```

`close()` closes a file descriptor, so that it no longer refers to any file and may be reused. It returns zero on success and -1 on failure.

### Inet_ntop()

```
#include <arpa/inet.h>

const char *inet_ntop(int af, const void *src, char *dst, socklen_t size);
```

`inet_ntop()` converts the network address structure src in the af address family into a character string. The resulting string is copied to the buffer pointed to by dst, which must be a non-null pointer. The caller specifies the number of bytes available in this buffer in the argument size.

1. `af` is the address family.
2. `src` is the pointer to the network address structure.

```
#include <pthread.h>

int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr, void *(*start_routine) (void *), void *arg);
